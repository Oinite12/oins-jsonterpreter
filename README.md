This is a tool for viewing JSON files that contain forum thread information. The threads in question come from the old Fandom thread system, which has since been depreciated in favor of discussions.

The tool to create these JSON files has yet to be released (Oinite is still cleaning up their code). The format that the JSONterpreter recognizes is very particular, so any JSONs you may have will not work with this tool.

Very much still a work in progress.
